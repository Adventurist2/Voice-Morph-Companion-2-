# Week 3: Audio and CNN Assignment

## Introduction

This repository contains the assignments and resources for Week 3 of our Project Voice Morph Companion . The assignments aim to provide hands-on experience with audio datasets and the implementation of CNNs.The Documents in the Directory tend to explain the concepts to a greater depth.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ElectronicsClub-IITK/Voice-Morph-Companion.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Week 3
    ```


## Usage



### Utilizing CNN Resources

1. The `CNN Resources` directory contains additional materials:
    - `CNN.pdf`: A PDF document providing theoretical background on CNNs.
    - `MNIST_notebook.ipynb`: An example notebook using the MNIST dataset to demonstrate CNN implementation.
### Running the CNN Assignment

1. Navigate to the `CNN Assignment` directory:
    ```bash
    cd CNN Assignment
    ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `Assignment.ipynb` and run the cells to execute the assignment.
3. Fill in the Blank Places and Solve the Assignment

### Audio and CNN Assignment

1. Navigate to the `CNN Assignment` directory:
    ```bash
    cd Audio and CNN Assignment
    ```
2. The Assignment involves classifying the insumruments in *TinySOL Dataset*
3. Give a reading through the Readme and you'll understand what has to be done in the Assignment.
