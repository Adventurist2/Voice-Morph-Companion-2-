# Week 2

## Introduction

This repository contains various assignments, datasets, and resources for different machine learning and data analysis topics. The content is organized into multiple sections, each focusing on specific methods or techniques, to provide hands-on experience and deeper understanding.This was a part of our project Voice Morph Companion in it's Week 2

## Usage
The Goal in this week is to get the mentees acquinted with all the Remaning Concepts of Simple Machine Learning, Explore Clustering and then start Working on Deep Learning concepts of MLP. 
Please refer to the Directories in the following order 
1. Random Forests and Decision Tress Resouces
2. Random Forests and Decision Tress Assignment
3. Principal Component Analysis
4. PCA Assignment
5. Exploratory Data Analysis Examples
6. Clustering Examples
7. Clustering Assignment
8. Deep Learning MLP
9. MLP Assignment
## Dependencies

- Python 3.9.9 or above
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries specified in `requirements.txt` or equivalent.

## Configuration

No special configuration is required. Ensure you have all dependencies installed and Jupyter Notebook is properly set up.

## Documentation

- Detailed explanations and instructions are provided within the Jupyter notebooks.
- Additional theoretical background can be found in the PDF documents within each directory.

## Examples

Examples are provided within the Jupyter notebooks:

- `MLP-Assignment.ipynb` in the `MLP Assignment` directory.
- `PrincipalComponentAnalysis.ipynb` in the `Principal Component Analysis` directory.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Verify the Jupyter Notebook server is running.
- Consult the README files within each directory for specific instructions.
